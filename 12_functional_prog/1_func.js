//procedural paradigm ->  write code line by line in a procedural way
//OOPs -> write code in a object oriented way
//functional programming -> write code in a functional way

//functional programming -> imperative and declarative
//functional programming is based on declarative code writing

//tasks -> 
//1. understand imperative and declarative programming and why declarative is better
//2. understand pure functions and their side effects
//3. mutability and immutability, functional programming is based on immutability
//4. understand higher order functions and their usage, ow to write them in declarative way
//5. higher order functions -> map, filter, reduce, also understand their polyfills
// polyfills means the imperative code or what is the logic behind these functions
